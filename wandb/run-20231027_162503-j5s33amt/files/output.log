/home/shawn/Projects/LLM_ARC_Solver/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/trl/trainer/sft_trainer.py:214: UserWarning: You passed a tokenizer with `padding_side` not equal to `right` to the SFTTrainer. This might lead to some unexpected behaviour due to overflow issues when training a model in half-precision. You might consider adding `tokenizer.padding_side = 'right'` to your code.
  warnings.warn(
You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
